# AI Antivirus & Virus/Malware Safety
AuraGen video model integrates an AI-powered antivirus system:
- All generated code/data is auto-scanned for malware/trojans/virus payloads
- Threats blocked by heuristic keyword search and deep neural tagging
- Malicious payloads repelled: transformed until safe or blocked

Malware keywords (trojan, virus, exploit, etc.) and behavioral scans are actively enforced.
No malicious code or data can pass through or be included in output.
